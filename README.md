# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Page — Vini Bobato

Hi there! I'm **Vinicius (Vini) Bobato**, a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University with a deep interest in **cybersecurity**, **machine learning**, **networking**, and **AI applications in critical systems**.

## 🔧 What I Do

- 🧠 **AI & ML** — I work on image segmentation, land cover classification, and anomaly detection using models like SegFormer, DeepLabV3+, and Random Forests.
- 🔒 **Cybersecurity Research** — From intrusion detection systems (IDS) using the IoT-23 dataset to building intelligent firewalls, I explore how machine learning can enhance network security.
- 🌐 **Networking & Simulation** — I run simulated DoS attacks, analyze traffic with Wireshark, and emulate networks using CORE for security testing and research.
- 🤖 **Automation & IoT** — I’ve built real-time aquarium monitoring systems with Raspberry Pi and explored secure communications in embedded devices.
